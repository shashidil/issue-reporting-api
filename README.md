## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher installed.
- Apache Maven installed (for building the project).
- A MySQL database or another database of your choice configured (update `application.properties` with the database connection details).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/system-issue-reporting-api.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd system-issue-reporting-api
   ```

3. Build the project using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   java -jar target/system-issue-reporting-api-<version>.jar
   ```

The API should now be running and accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Usage

### Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoints:

- `GET /issues`: Retrieve a list of all issues.
- `GET /issues/{id}`: Retrieve a specific issue by its ID.
- `POST /issues`: Create a new issue.
- `PUT /issues/{id}`: Update an existing issue by its ID.
- `DELETE /issues/{id}`: Delete an issue by its ID.

### Examples

#### Retrieving All Issues

```http
GET /issues
```

#### Retrieving a Specific Issue

```http
GET /issues/1
```

#### Creating a New Issue

```http
POST /issues
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "New Issue",
  "description": "Description of the new issue",
  "priority": "HIGH"
}
```

#### Updating an Existing Issue

```http
PUT /issues/1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "Updated Issue Title",
  "description": "Updated description"
}
```

#### Deleting an Issue

DELETE /issues/1
```

## Authentication

The System Issue Reporting API does not currently implement authentication. It is essential to secure the API for production use. You can integrate authentication mechanisms such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens), OAuth 2.0, or API keys depending on your requirements.

## Error Handling

The API handles errors with appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages in the response body. Be sure to check the response status code and body for error details when using the API.
